# client-admin
Geosurveys client admin, is the administration site for geosurveys, used in ChildrensMaps (Barnkartor). This is an early release with very few options available at the moment. It just exposes login-options, and the option to add participant-IDÂ´s to surveys and see the status of each participant ID and finally to manage the Whitelist of text answers.
